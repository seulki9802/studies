C. Smith. It is sometimes claimed that Kerouac typed the original scroll of On the Road on his Underwood portable, but most likely it was "this antique L.C. Smith typewriter I’m taking to Frisco" (letter to Neal Cassady, 10 January 1951, Selected Letters I, 294). This is probably the big typewriter described in Kerouac's journal: "MONDAY SEPTEMBER 17, 1951 – Had to go to N.Y. to pick up work at 20th Century Fox and my typewriter in Lucien’s loft.  . . . – at 4 a.m. I staggered across the field with my big old typewriter that my father used in Lowell Mass. before I was even born ... the typewriter with which I not only wrote The Town and the City but my earliest loomings in 1937. If all my life, in spite of anything that happens, is connected by that typewriter to the one unswerving idealistic purpose which was revealed to me in youthful dreams of pure glory, then I don’t care if it weighs a ton as I carry it across the night." Thanks to Kerouac expert Matt Theado for this information.
